TiddlyWiki Plugin for managing IT


## Local Development

The development environment can be invoked by:

```bash
npm run develop
```

This runs the Tiddlywiki server and reloads it if any of the development files change.
So, change the code and then bounce the browser page to see changes.

## Read-Only Mode

Read only mode is turned on by creating the following tiddler:
